# NetworkIntrusionDetection

Problem Formulation :
Software to detect network intrusions protects a computer network from unauthorized users, including perhaps insiders. 
This project aims to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, 
called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections.Model this problem as a BINARY classification problem. 
Use the following models to detect bad connections (intrusions).


Models used to predict bad intrusions :
• Logistic Regression
• Nearest Neighbor
• Support Vector Machine
• Fully-Connected Neural Networks
